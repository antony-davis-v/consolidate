        Use of Cookies
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Valuenode website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your
        online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard
        disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
        deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you,
        and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the
        cookie to you.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
        feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
        server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
        personalize Valuenode pages, or register with Valuenode site or
        services, a cookie helps Valuenode to recall your specific information
        on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your
        personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and
        so on. When you return to the same Valuenode website, the information
        you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the
        Valuenode features that you customized.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers
        automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
        setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
        cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
        features of the Valuenode services or websites you visit.
